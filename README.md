Vulkan Renderer. Work in progress. All testing was done on (AMD R9 480)
- Warning. Take the code with grain of salt as it might violate Vulkan specs.
- Big Warning. Some of resources are not freed correctly. Work in progress...
- Always happy to hear what could be fixed or improved.
- Still have validation errors on some projects. Work in progress....

# How to Build
Currently works only under windows.

Go to ScriptsWin32 folder
* Run ConfigAndBuildDependencies.bat -> It will build dependencies and will create their .libs and .dlls files
* Go to External\freetype\builds\windows\vc2017 and build Debug and Release (No multithreading)
* Run Config.bat -> Will create new folder 'Build' and will create project solution.
* Then run Build_Debug.bat or Build_Release.bat which will compile the project.


In order to get working. You need to have working Vulkan driver and Vulkan SDK that you can download from LunarG site

The fonts texture were generated using Freetype2 library. The texture format that is generated by freetype is VK_FORMAT_R8_UNORM
For each glyph a texture is generated and put it into descriptors list. Of course it very bad thing to do.
The best thing is to have one texture for all glyps and point to specific char UV coordinates. In order to have alpha enabled you need
to enable blending in your VkPipeline.
First one is using signed distance field, the second one(down) does not use signed distance field.
There are still some strange edge bleeding which I do not know really why.

There are issues with normal mapping. Shader is not complete.
Using TBN Matrix convert view vector and light vector to tangent space. Doing this results in black model.
Using my own wavefront parser.

Shader (should be renamed to gpu instead of cpu... cuz gpu skinning it is) - [Static Model Shader](Assets/Shaders/SkeletalAnimation)
GPU skinning of MD5 file. MD5 file usually have less then 9 bones per vertex (usually max is 4 in game industry), so had to setup second vec4 for boneWeight and jointId. Also, glm does not handle well small angles so had to use different version of slerp which would handle small angles. Some info about getting MD5 rendering part is here -> https://github.com/gszauer/3DAnimation/blob/master/MD5/README.md

It uses only two textures. Both textures are compressed and their format is VK_FORMAT_R32G32B32A32_UINT. First texture has compressed position and specular texture, both of them are vec3 type. We waste one A32 component. For some reason got it working only with 4 components (will need to try fixing it). Second texture has packed Normal, Diffuse and Depth textures. If you would look at better compression algorithms, you could definetily find a way to pack Position, Diffuse and Specular in single R32G32B32 but of course you would lose precision. The solution I'm using this time gave the best results without any loss in quality. The only problem is that the output looks litlle bit squashed.
